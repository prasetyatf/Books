Evaluation Metrics & Scoring
...it is important to choose the right metric when selecting between models and adjusting parameters.

Keep The End Goal In Mind
not just making a prediction but using these predictions as part of a larger decisionmaking process
business metric = Before picking a machine learning metric, you should think about the high-level goal of the application.
business impact = The consequences of choosing a particular algorithm for a machine learning application.
In the early stages of development, and for adjusting parameters, it is often infeasible-
to put models into production just for testing purposes, because of the high business or personal risks that can be involved.

Metrics for Binary Classification
Kinds of Error
Often, accuracy is not a good measure of predictive performance, as the number of-
mistakes we make does not contain all the information we are interested in. 
For any application, we need to ask ourselves what the consequences of these mistakes might be in the real world.
false positive / type I error: Incorrect positive prediction -> a healthy guy detected has a cancer
false negative / type II error: Incorrect negative prediction -> a guy with cancer detected as healthy guy
Imbalanced datasets
Confusion matrices
