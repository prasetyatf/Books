Chapter 2: Choosing an effective visual
--Verbal System: Simple Text, Tabular, Heatmap(mix with visual)
--Visual System: Heatmap(mix with visual), Graph(points, lines, bars, and area)
visual system is faster processing information than verbal system
my opinion based on how many datas to show, if 1-3 datas to show, we could use simple text. 
>3 datas to show, we use bar chart. many datas to show, we use tabular/heat map.
in this book, chart=graph
--Scatterplots can be useful for showing the relationship between two things.
--Line graphs are most commonly used to plot continuous data(days,months etc.). There is line graph and slope graph.
--Line Graph can show a single series of data, or multiple series. Be consistent in the time points you plot
