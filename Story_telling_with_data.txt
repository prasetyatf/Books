Chapter 2: Choosing an effective visual
--Verbal System: Simple Text, Tabular, Heatmap(mix with visual)
--Visual System: Heatmap(mix with visual), Graph(points, lines, bars, and area)
visual system is faster processing information than verbal system
my opinion based on how many datas to show, if 1-3 datas to show, we could use simple text. 
>3 datas to show, we use bar chart. many datas to show, we use tabular/heat map or bar chart with multiple series.
in this book, chart=graph
--Scatterplots can be useful for showing the relationship between two things.
--Line graphs are most commonly used to plot continuous data(days,months etc.). There is line graph and slope graph.
--Line Graph can show a single series of data, or multiple series. Be consistent in the time points you plot
-- Slopegraphs can be useful when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly-
show relative increases and decreases.
...our attention is drawn immediately to the decrease in “Career development,”(the orange) while-
the rest of the data(the grey) is preserved for context without competing for attention.(discuss in Chapter 4)
--Bar Chart is easy to read and its common.
Our eyes compare the end points of the bars, so it is easy to see quickly which category is the-
biggest, which is the smallest, and also the incremental difference between categories.
bar charts always have a zero baseline (where the x‐axis crosses the y‐axis at zero),-
otherwise you get a false visual comparison.
There’s no hard‐and‐fast rule here, but in general the bars should be wider than the white space between the bars.
You don’t want the bars to be so wide, however, that your audience wants to compare areas instead of lengths.
bar charts can be single series, or multiple series. more series is more complex.
--Vertical bar chart
Be aware, there is visual grouping that happens as a result of the spacing in bar charts having more than one data series.
--Waterfall chart
to show a starting point, increases and decreases, and the resulting ending point.
--Stacked vertical bar chart
It is hard to compare the subcomponents across the various categories once you get beyond the bottom series.
--Horizontal bar chart
useful if your category names are long
--Stacked horizontal bar chart
...
--Area
The writer avoids it, except when he needs to visualize numbers of vastly different magnitudes.
--Other chart
...
--Avoid pie charts, donut charts, 3D, and secondary y‐axes

Chapter 4: Focuse your audience's attention
Understanding how people sees and how you can use that to your advantage when crafting visuals.
Preattentive attribute
First, preattentive attributes can be leveraged to help direct your audience’s attention to where you want-
them to focus it. 
Second, they can be used to create a visual hierarchy of elements to lead your audience through the information-
you want to communicate in the way you want them to process it.
--You see with your brain
We dont fully see with eyes, but also some processing in brain called visual presception.
--A brief lesson on memory
Type of memory: iconic memory, short‐term memory, and long‐term memory.
--Iconic memory
its great efficiency of sight and speed of response. it is tuned to a set of preattentive attributes.
we gained it through human evolutionary chain.
--Short-term memory
 people can keep about four chunks of visual information in their short‐term memory at a given time.
 reducing that work of going back and forth between the legend and the data by leveraging the Gestalt principle-
 of proximity.
 --Long-term memory
 When something leaves short‐term memory, it either lost forever or it passed to Long-term memory.
 By combining the visual and verbal,we set ourselves up for success when it comes to triggering the formation-
 of long‐term memories in our audience.
