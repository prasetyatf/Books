why learn sql? writing applications, performing administrative tasks, or generating reports
why use this book to do it? the book says that this is the only book that provides detailed coverage of the SQL language without the added-
benefit of doubling as a “door stop”.
SQL schema statements = Statements used to create database objects (tables, indexes, constraints, etc.).(usually for administrator)
SQL data statements = The statements used to create, manipulate, and retrieve the data stored in a database.(usually for programmer or reporter).

Chapt. 1. Alittle Background
why database is better than phone book.
nonrelational database
before relational db, computerized dbs using various ways to store data like tree structure(hierarchial database system), network database system.
In 1970, data be represented as sets of tables. Rather than using pointers to navigate between related entities, redundant data is used to link records in different tables.
The number of rows that a table may contain is more a matter of physical limits(disk drive).
Each table in a relational database includes information that uniquely identifies a row in that table (known as the primary key), along with additional information needed to describe the entity completely. 
primary key columns should never be allowed to change once a value has been assigned.
a primary key consisting of two or more columns is known as a
compound key
