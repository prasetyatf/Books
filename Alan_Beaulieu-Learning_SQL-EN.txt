why learn sql? writing applications, performing administrative tasks, or generating reports
why use this book to do it? the book says that this is the only book that provides detailed coverage of the SQL language without the added-
benefit of doubling as a “door stop”.
SQL schema statements = Statements used to create database objects (tables, indexes, constraints, etc.).(usually for administrator)
SQL data statements = The statements used to create, manipulate, and retrieve the data stored in a database.(usually for programmer or reporter).
