1. What is deeplearning?
AI(ML(DL)).
AI was born in 1950.
Symbolic AI is large set of explicit rules for manipulating knowledge(1950-1980).
Symbolic AI: input + algorythm = output.
but is is still hard to solve problem like image classification, speech recognition, etc. soon Machine Learning
is taking symbolic AI's place.
Machine Learning: input + output = algorhytm.
ML become popular in 1990s where the availability of faster hardware and larger dataset.
ML is relaed to statistic but it is differ, bcs ML deal with larger complex dataset and some classical statistic will become impractical.
